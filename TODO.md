## Phase 5: HTTP SSE Transport Implementation (v0.4.0) - **✅ COMPLETED**

### MCP Server Transport Migration
**Background**: Current STDIO transport has timeout limitations causing test failures and agent interaction issues. HTTP transport with SSE provides better timeout control, session management, and reliability.

**Reference**: [MCP HTTP Transport Docs](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#streamable-http)

  - Session management with session ID headers for stateful connections
  - Support both single JSON responses and SSE streams for multiple messages
  - Configurable server (default: localhost:3000, configurable port/host)
  - Maintained backward compatibility with STDIO for development

- [x] **Session & Connection Management** - ✅ COMPLETED: Stateful HTTP sessions
  - Session initialization and persistence implemented
  - Session termination handling with proper cleanup
  - Connection state management for multiple concurrent clients
  - Proper session cleanup and resource management in place

  - HTTPS support configuration ready for production deployments
  - Authentication mechanisms integrated with existing session manager
  - Request validation and rate limiting per session

- [x] **Timeout & Reliability Management** - ✅ COMPLETED: HTTP transport timeout and reliability features
  - HTTP request timeout settings (default: 120s, configurable)
  - SSE connection timeout handling and keep-alive implemented
  - Graceful timeout responses with proper error codes
  - Circuit breaker pattern for repeated connection failures
  - Request queuing with timeout for high-load scenarios

- [x] **Client Configuration Updates** - ✅ COMPLETED: Update all client configurations for HTTP transport
  - Claude Desktop config: `"command": "http://localhost:3000/mcp"`
  - ADK agent HTTP transport configuration examples added

  - Concurrent client connections and session isolation tests
  - STDIO tests maintained for backward compatibility

- [x] **Implementation Dependencies** - ✅ COMPLETED: Add required HTTP transport dependencies
  - FastAPI and Uvicorn for HTTP server (`fastapi>=0.104.0, uvicorn>=0.24.0`)
  - SSE support libraries (`sse-starlette>=1.8.0`)
  - JSON-RPC 2.0 handling (`jsonrpclib-pelix>=0.4.3`)
