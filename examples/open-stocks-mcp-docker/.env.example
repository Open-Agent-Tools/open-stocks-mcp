# SECURITY NOTES
# ===========================================
# 1. MFA/2FA is now FULLY SUPPORTED via mobile app notifications
#    Keep your Robinhood mobile app accessible during login
# 2. Device verification is automatically handled - approve new devices in your mobile app
# 3. Use a strong, unique password for your Robinhood account
# 4. Never share or commit your .env file to version control
# 5. Consider using environment-specific credentials for different deployments
# 6. Regularly rotate your credentials for security

# ===========================================
# DEVICE VERIFICATION PROCESS
# ===========================================
# When starting the container for the first time, Robinhood may require
# device verification. The server will automatically handle this workflow:
#
# 1. Monitor logs: docker-compose logs -f
# 2. Look for: "Device verification prompt: Check robinhood app..."
# 3. Open your Robinhood mobile app
# 4. Approve the device verification notification
# 5. Wait for: "Login successful with device verification"
#
# This process typically only happens once per device/container.
